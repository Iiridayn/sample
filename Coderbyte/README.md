Various solutions to Coderbyte.com programming challenges - I did these while first experimenting with Python... I know the code is imperfect, but is a reasonable representation of my progress learning Python. Each challenge was timed, with half the points derived from quick solutions.

I have 09a and 09b because I'm not quite sure when I did these ones. I know it was fairly early on, so I stuffed them at 09, but they were out of sequence from the rest. The order isn't 100% perfect either aside from that, but it should be mostly correct.
