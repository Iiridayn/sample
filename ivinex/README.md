I was looking at the time for a job, so I applied at Ivinix. They asked me to show some sample code, by creating a simple webpage for them, and to demonstrate various programming techniques. The data appears to be publically available at http://www.patientrewardshub.com/contactus, so I'll show what they gave me.

I didn't finish the project; I realized pretty quickly that I wouldn't enjoy working with them then and dropped my application.
