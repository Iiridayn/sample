=========

I quickly tossed this together some years ago as a quick demonstration of some programming style. Please note that this is not meant to be MVC code - the SQL in the view is there largely as a novelty to me. The main purpose was to prove that I could connect to a database, handle basic setup, functions, simple templating, etc. Had I continued I would have developed it into a mini-MVC framework to demonstrate classes/objects, etc. This code is 2011 era.
