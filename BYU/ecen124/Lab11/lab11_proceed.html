</u>
<ol>
  <li>Download the <a href="lab11.c">lab11.c</a> skeleton code.</li>
  <li>Read over the code until you are comfortable with what it does.</li>
  <li>Download <a href="ADD.mco"> ADD.mco</a> and <a href="ADD.asm">
ADD.asm</a></li>
  <li>Open ADD.asm and familiarize yourself with the instructions.  You
need to know what the output/resulting data in registers/memory should
be for those instructions.</li>
  <li>Compile the skeleton code.</li>
  <li>Run your program with debug turned on and ADD.mco as the
filename. <pre>Example:   <b>./lab11 1 ADD.mco</b></pre></li>
  <li>It should output a TO-DO message and exit.  The TO-DO message
should specifically tell you which function you need to implement.</li>
  <li>Find the function in the skeleton code and implement it.</li>
  <li>Run the program again testing it to make sure that the function
does what it is supposed to do</li>
  <li>Remove the TO-DO message and exit code from the function</li>
  <li>Run the program again.</li>
  <li>It should output another TO-DO message and exit.</li>
  <li>Repeat the above process until ADD.mco completely works. This
means extensive testing!</li>
  <li>Once ADD.mco works, repeat the entire process again this time
using <a href="AND.mco">AND.mco </a>and <a href="AND.asm">AND.asm</a>
or other .mco files you create to implement other instructions.</li>
  <li>Repeat (kind of an annoying word isn't it) this process until you
have implemented all of the functions in the skeleton code and all of
the lc3 instructions.</li>
  <li>Finally (the definition of finally usually implies do this at the
END) run your program with <a href="lab4.mco"> lab4.mco</a> which is the
copy of lab4 with which we will test your program.  Test it to make
sure it works.  Note: TA's will not help you debug your program on
lab4.mco if you have not already debugged your program using the
shorter .mco files provided for you.</li>
  <li>Finally (#2) test your program using our copies of 
<a href="lab3.mco">lab3</a>, <a href="lab5.mco">lab5</a> and 
<a href="lab6.mco">lab6</a> to make sure your program works with those 
programs.</li>
