This is code written for ECEn 124. I have ommitted Labs 1 and 2 - 1 was to submit a lab, and 2 didn't require any programming. The .asm files contain LC3 assembly, while the .mco files contain LC3 machine code, written in hexadecimal.

The java executed by assembler.bat expects a filepath without extension to a .asm file. The java esecuted by convert.bat expects a filepath without extension to a .mco file. The output will be loaded by the java executed by the simulator.bat file.
