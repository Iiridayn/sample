A) A:\Test.java:1: class test is public, should be declared in a file named test.java
   There is no file named 'test', only one named 'Test'.  The class and the filename must be the same.

B) No errors; Text within a string will be output regardless of what it says.

C) A:\Test.java:5: ')' expected
		System.out.println (An Emergency Broadcast");
                                       ^
   A:\Test.java:5: unclosed string literal
		System.out.println (An Emergency Broadcast");
                                                          ^
   A:\Test.java:5: ';' expected
		System.out.println (An Emergency Broadcast");
                                                             ^
   A:\Test.java:5: cannot resolve symbol
   symbol  : variable An  
   location: class Test

                                    ^
   4 errors
   Finished
   
   The location of the string is defined by the quotes, so removing one messes up the boundaries of the string.

D) A:\Test.java:5: unclosed string literal
		System.out.println ("An Emergency Broadcast);
                                    ^
   A:\Test.java:5: ')' expected
		System.out.println ("An Emergency Broadcast);
                                                             ^
   2 errors
   Finished

   Once again, a mess as a result of impropper definition of the string's location.

E) No error, until run.  It tries to find the main method then, and fails, so it exits.

F) A:\Test.java:5: cannot resolve symbol
   symbol  : method bogus  (java.lang.String)
   location: class java.io.PrintStream
		System.out.bogus ("An Emergency Broadcast");
                          ^
   1 error
   Finished

   There is no command defined as that name, so when it searches for the place to pass the variable, it gets annoyed.

G) No errors, see B)

H) A:\Test.java:5: ';' expected
		System.out.println ("An Emergency Broadcast")
                                                             ^
   1 error
   Finished

   The ';' defines the endof the statement.  Because of the absence of one, it wasn't sure where the statement ended.

I) A:\Test.java:6: '}' expected
	}
         ^
   1 error
   Finished

   Once again, the endof everything must be defined.  In this case, I never ended the class.
