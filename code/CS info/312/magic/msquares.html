<h1> Magic Squares</h1> 

Implement a backtracking algorithm to solve the magic squares problem.
You will need to invent a function that decides when to backtrack. 

<h2> Problem </h2> 

Given a set of n^2  numbers and two vectors of n
numbers arrange the n^2 numbers into an n by n table such that the sum
of each row and the sum of each column match the corresponding value
in the vectors.  <p>

For example, if you are given the numbers 
<pre>
1 3 5 1 13 2 2 3 8 
</pre> 
and the vectors
<pre>
13 16 9 and 10 19 9 
</pre> 
then one possible solution is: 
<pre> 
8  3  2  = 13
1  13 2  = 16 
1  3  5  = 9 
=  =  = 
10 19 9 
</pre> 

For more examples, see any of a number of magic square solvers available online. 

<h2>Input</h2> 

You'll be given a file containing a magic squares problem of size 1,2
or 3.  The file format is:
<ol>
<li> Problem size as a single integer on the first line
<li> A single candidate per line on the next n*n lines. 
<li> A row target, one per line, for the next n lines, and 
<li> A column target, one per line, for the remaining n lines. 
</ol>
Several examples are given below.  Each number will be smaller than
9999--including row and column values. 

<h2>Output</h2> Output a solution to the magic squares problem and the
number of assignments of values to the magic square you made before
finding a solution.  (see <a href="http://vv.cs.byu.edu/cs312/">the
blog</a> for more details) The output format is:

<pre> 
[jones@phirewall magic-square]$ msquare easy.txt
4       3       7
2       1       3
6       4
22
</pre> 
in which 22 is the number of assignments made before
finding a solution.

If no solution is possible, output the number of assignments you
made without finding a solution.  For example, 
<pre>
[jones@phirewall magic-square]$ msquare unsolvable.txt
362880
</pre> 
in which 362880 is the number of assignments made although a solution was not found. 


If no solution is possible, then your program might generate upto
(n^2)! (that's n squared factorial) complete squares and make far more
assignments.  Your backtracking algorithm should make much fewer.

<h2>Burning Question</h2> 

Given a partially filled-in magic square, how do you determine if it
will lead to a solution or not?  Will your method for pruning the
search work if we allow negative numbers?

<h2>What to turn in</h2> 

As usual, mail your burning answer to your instructor
(jones@cs.byu.edu or egm@cs.byu.edu) and run Make handin to submit
your project.  The Makefile will only submit your msquare.cc file.  If
you use multiple files, you'll need to modify the makefile. 

<h2>Grading</h2> 

For full credit, your program should correctly any magic 3x3 magic
square problem in under 1 minute.  We will be grading based on the number
of assignments made.  For full credit, you should never make the complete amount of assignments. 

<h2> Sample Files</h2> 

<ul>
<li> <a href="easy.txt">n=2</a> has a solution.
<li> <a href="hard.txt">n=3</a> has a solution. 
<li> <a href="unsolvable.txt">n=3</a> does not have a solution
</ul>

<h2> Helpful Hints</h2> 

There are probably smarter and easier ways to solve this problem, but
the following ideas are pretty smart and easy.

<ul> 

<li> Start with an empty matrix and fill it in cell by cell.  A
significant challenge is determining which candidate to put in the
next cell.  You've got to implement something that allows any and each
of the candidates to be in the next cell.  I did this with a for-loop
on n and a function that returns the ith unused candidate for a given
value of i.  To do that, I had to devise a way to mark a candidate as
"used" then loop through the unused candidates.  This list of unused
candiadates was then propogated to each recursive call.

<li> You can implement depth first search either recursively or using
a stack.  If you implement it recursively, remember that C only allows
arrays to be passed by reference.  That means that a pointer to the
same array is passed to every recursive call (which means the child
actualy modifies the parent's version of the array).  That means that
you can either unmodify the array before returning from a recursive
call or you can allocate a new array in each recursive call. Either
method will work for this project.  You've got to think this through
for every parameter and local variable in your recursive function.
Its not hard, if you are careful about what's going on in C.

<li> If you implement your DFS using a stack, be sure you have
everything you need in your stack frame structure (the stack frame
structure is the datastructure that you'll push onto the stack).
You'll need enough information to figure out which child to generate
next.  This includes knowing: which cell to fill in next, which
candidate to use next, which candidates have been used in the current
matrix and which candidates have been used for the next cell.  You'll
need all the same information for the recursive implementation, but
some of the information gets stored as local variables in the stack of
recursive function calls.  If you don't have enough information to
figure out whether or not all of the children have been generated,
then you don't have enough information.

<li> When you've got a completely full matrix, call a function that
checks a matrix to see if the matrix is a solution.  This function
basically just adds the rows and columns to see if they sum to the
correct values.  This used to be the way to count for performance, but
we are now counting the number of assignments made rather than the
number of complete arrays generated.

<li> There are lots of ways to do the search more efficiently than
what I've described above.  Feel free to implement these if you like.
</ul>
