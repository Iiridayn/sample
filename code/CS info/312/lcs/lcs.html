<h1> Length of Longest Common Subsequences</h1> 

<h2> Problem</h2> 

Find the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) of two
strings.  Answer the burning question.  For extra credit, find the
actual LCS in addition to its length.  See the <a
href="lcs.pdf">handout</a> for a more detailed definition and
recursive equation.

<h2> Input</h2> 

You'll be given a file containing to strings.  Each string ends with a
newline character and may contain arbitrary characters including
spaces and punctuation.  Each string may contain upto 20,000
characters.  The strings may or may not be the same length.

<h2> Output </h2> 

Your program should print the length of the longest common subsequence
for the given strings.  The definition of the longest common
subsequence (LCS) and an equation for finding the LCS are given in a <a href="lcs.pdf">handout</a>.

This lab includes a <b>Burning Question</b>.  The burning question is: 
<blockquote> 
What is the big-O bound on the amount of memory used by your program?
Justify your bound with a proof.
</blockquote>
As always, answering the burning question is a key factor in the
design and implementation of your algorithm.

<h2> Grading</h2> 

The absolute performance requirement is 5 seconds of CPU time (as
measured by /usr/bin/time) for any valid input file.  We are not going
to use the cycle accurate timing harness this time around--but may for
later projects.

Its a "good thing" to post your performance results to the blog <a
href="http://vv.cs.byu.edu/cs312/archives/000437.html">entry for
performance results</a>.  When you do, report user time, tell which
machine you are using and which test case you are using.  <h2> Sample

<h2>Project Distribution and Handin</h2>

The project distribution (<a
href="http://vv.cs.byu.edu/~jones/cs312/lcs-dyn-prog.tar.gz">lcs-dyn-prog.tar.gz<a>)
includes a Makefile but does not include file IO or timing files.  You
are on your own for file IO and use /usr/bin/time for timing.  Do
"make handin" as usual to turn in your project.  Be sure to put your
code in lcs.cc. Mail your answer to the burning question to your
professor (jones@cs.byu.edu or egm@cs.byu.edu).
