3 types of mana:
lvl max
cur max
cur

+1% to cur max (< lvl max (random added to at lvl up)) at xp gain?
Can drop cur max using some spells, overeaching self

mana recharge at % rate?

all stats, lvl, recharge, @ %?

but give real values!

problem: lvl difference is BIG
pk !worky
problem SLOW to start

ideas: logarithmic?
opposite.
FAST start, later lvl diff SMALL

ideas: linear?
EVEN rate, lvl diff TINY

want high lvl diff > low lvl diff
+func(lvl)? (n!(but for +, not *))? - Factorial progression

meditate upon this truth


Skill name I, skill name II, skill name III, for diff strength, diff lvl - skill upgrade

skill str based % effect changes by skill level (of skill, and of player)
net: skill works throughout
