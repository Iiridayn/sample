Alarm clock program:

call with the time to ring (24 or 12, 12 assumes next 12)
discovers time until then, and sleeps (?) till that time
can also give arg of total time

Rings something, and listens at the keyboard for input.
if it gets a time, snoozes until then
if it gets a number, snoozes that many minutes
if it gets a whitespace only, it snoozes for a default period (5 mins?)

need an input parser that can handle 12, 24 hr time formats, and normal numbers, and ignore other strings w/o dying.  Swappable alarm functions?

also have alarm function and signal, can look into that too
- is for doing other things at the same time, !worky


-- need to instantly read a typed character
-- need to not wait for a char when I try to read while alarm is going off
