a^2 + b^2 = c^2
a + b + c = 1000

c = 1000 - a - b
c = (a^2 + b^2)^0.5
a + b + (a^2 + b^2)^0.5 = 1000
- dead end.

# Euclid's formula:
a = m^2 - n^2
b = 2mn
c = m^2 + n^2

m^2 - n^2 + 2mn + m^2 + n^2 = 1000
2m^2 + 2mn = 1000
m^2 + mn = 500
n = (500 - m^2)/m

Picked m = 20 as a first guess, n was 5.

a = 375
b = 200
c = 425

check: a + b + c = 1000.

abc = 31875000
