Okay, this is a fungeoid language they call SuperHack, and is difficult to
comment. We add a 0 to the stack, and use another to enter the first loop
 - where we read input until we reach a 0 (duplicating it on the stack to
test it). We then Print each ascii character off the stack, duplicating each
 again before testing, and finish up with the last null terminator (the
sentinal from the setup).
